The acquisition of Solvay’s European Performance Polyamides Business (Polytechnyl) by DOMO initiated a change in Technyl® products distribution structure. From May 1, 2020, in addition to offering DOMO’s historical range of products, Ultrapolymers will operate as the pan European distributor for the company’s Technyl® products.</p><p>Marc Swatosch, European Product Manager at Ultrapolymers states: “Through this partnership with DOMO, one of the largest players in the polyamide market, we will be able to broaden our offering with a top quality PA6 and PA66 portfolio into all European countries with the exception of Serbia and Russia. Ultrapolymers’ existing DOMAMID® and ECONAMID® customers can expect to enjoy the same standards of service, but with an even broader offering.”</p><p><b>From May 1, Ultrapolymers will distribute the complete DOMO portfolio of PA6 and PA66, PPA and PPS based technical polymers sold under the TECHNYL®, DOMAMID®, THERMEC™ and ECONAMID® brands.&nbsp;</b>DOMO does not sell or distribute any Technyl® grades to customers and distributors outside the European Economic Area and Switzerland. TECHNYL® is a registered trademark of DOMO.</p><p>Besides being the number 2 polyamide producer in Europe, DOMO has focused on the development of sustainable solutions. With the Polytechnyl acquisition, the company’s sustainable product range has expanded significantly. It has added the Technyl® 4Earth® grades to the portfolio, which has been developed using recycled airbag fabric wastes.</p><p>Ron Bult, EP Global Sales Director at DOMO, says: "The partnership we have with Ultrapolymers has been very successful from the outset. Ultrapolymers is reliable, easy to work with, professional and always looking to provide commercial and technical solutions. By extending our partnership to include the Polytechnyl business, we can now reach end users across all European countries and respond quickly to fulfill the needs of small to medium sizes customers across the continent.”</p><p>The transition to Ultrapolymers will take two months. In order to ensure a seamless transition for customers and business continuity, the two companies have created a Q&amp;A document which outlines all the practical details of this important change.</p><p><b>About DOMO Chemicals</b></p><p>DOMO Chemicals is a leading producer of high-quality engineering nylon materials for a diverse range of markets, including the automotive, construction, industrial and consumer goods, food, medical, pharmaceutical, chemicals and electronics industries. The company offers a complete portfolio of integrated nylon 6 and 66 products, including intermediates, resins, engineering plastics, performance fibres, packaging film and distribution of petrochemical products.

Due to regulatory requirements and an increasing sense of product stewardship, a steadily growing number of plastics processors, suppliers and OEMs are looking for sustainable alternatives to conventional materials. This is why Ultrapolymers has greatly expanded its portfolio of engineering plastics with reduced environmental footprints, including Domo's Technyl® 4earth® polyamides. This distributor’s many years of experience in making substitutions of this kind means it can help customers put them quickly and successfully into use.&nbsp;</p><p>Technyl 4earth is based on post-industrial or used technical textiles from stable sources, such as automotive airbags, ensuring a consistently high level of properties. Compared to conventional PA6.6 grades, the carbon footprint is reduced by a quarter, consumption of non-renewable resources by half and water consumption by more than two-thirds, while maintaining approximately the same performance.
